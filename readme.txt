== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I be charged for receiving these text messages? =

Technically, yes. All standard carrier text-messaging fees still apply. If you are charged for receiving text messages, you will be charged for receiving text messages from TextMe. Normally, if you have an unlimited texting plan, you will not be charged anything by your carrier for that single text.

= My carrier isn't supported. What do I do? =

TextMe utilizes a email-to-SMS service that all of the supported carriers provide. If you are able to find this service for your unsupported carrier, it will be happily implemented. Visit the homepage of this plugin to tell me about it.
